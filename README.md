# Melanoma-Skin-Cancer-Classification
This repository contains the work of the paper which is being written for CVPR 2020.

The description of each script is stated here-

1. Augmentation.ipynb - The script is for Augmenting the images which are minority in class.
2. CNN+Graph.ipynb - The script is for testing the model by passing the shape and color based features through a FCNN
3. CNN_feature_extraction- This script is for extracting the shape based features.
4. Graph Feature.ipynb- This script is for extracting graph based features like adjacency matrix,etc.
5. GraphNN.ipynb- This script is for passing color based feature through a FCNN
6. graph_feature_extraction- This script is for color based feature extraction.
7. distribution- This script is for understanding the distribution of the images in the dataset
8. embedding- This script is for building the embedding for the graph.
9. graph_embedding + nn - This script is for trying out the model of passing the graph embedding through a FCNN
10. embedding+graph+nn- This script is the best model which ensembles graph embedding and shape based features and regional adjacency graph.
